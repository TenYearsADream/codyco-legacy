/**
 * @ingroup codyco_module
 * \defgroup codyco_wholeBodyReach wholeBodyReach
 *
 * This module implements a whole-body inverse-dynamics controller to achieve a reaching behavior.
 * The robot is supposed to reach with one hand while (possibly) using the other arm to make
 * contact with the environment to allow reaching farther in front of it.
 *
 * \section tasks_sec Stack Of Tasks
 * Currently the controlled tasks in order of priority are:
 * - contact constraints at both feet (12 dofs)
 * - com (or momentum, depending on the control algorithm) (3 or 6 dofs)
 * - right hand (3 dofs)
 * - left forearm (3 dofs)
 * - joint posture (25 dofs)
 *
 * Moreover the following inequality constraints are considered:
 * - joint limits
 * - max joint velocities
 * - max joint accelerations
 * - friction cones
 * - zero moment point (at each contact)
 *
 * In case of conflict between joint limits and joint velocities/accelerations, higher priority
 * is given to the joint limits.
 *
 * The control algorithm that gave the best results in simulation is COM_SOT (5), which controls
 * the CoM position, but not the angular momentum.
 *
 * \section config_sec Configuring the module
 * The module uses a large number of configuration parameters, which can be found in the file
 * conf/defaultSim.ini. More details on the module's parameters can be found by connecting to
 * the RPC port of the module (the port's name is "/moduleName/rpc") and typing "help".
 *
 * For sure the user needs to modify the parameter "urdf", which provides the complete path
 * to the urdf model of the robot.

 \section example_sec Example Instantiation of the Module
 First of all start the module specifying the configuration file:

     wholeBodyReach --from defaultSim.ini

 Then connect to the RPC port of the module:

     yarp rpc /wbr/rpc

 Then start the module by giving the start command on the RPC port.

     start

 At start all the desired positions are set to the measured positions, so the robot should not move.
 When the module is started the robot is supposed to be standing on both feet, with the feet parallel
 to each other. After the controller is started you can modify the reference positions of the different
 tasks. You can this in two ways; you can directly set the reference position of a task, e.g.:

     set xd com 0.04 -0.07 0.45

 Alternatively you can use the "go down" and "go up" commands, which change at the same time the desired
 positions of all the tasks (actually at the moment it is only for CoM, right hand and joint posture).

     go down

 The desired positions associated to the "go down" commands can be changed by configuration file
 or by rpc port through the parameters "go down com", "go down hand", "go down posture".
 The same applies for the "go up" command.

 \section scope_sec Monitoring the behavior of the controller
 A bunch of configuration files for plotting some useful quantities using yarpscope
 can be found in the conf folder. In particular:
 - com_scope: plot the reference and measured position of the CoM and angular momentum.
 - hand_forearm_scope: plot reference and measured positions of right hand and left forearm.
 - force_inequalities: plot the desired ZMPs, ratio of tangential and normal forces, ratio of normal
 moments and forces; namely it plots all the bounded quantities related to the contact forces. This
 is useful to monitor the robustness of the desired contact forces.
 - joint_limits: plot the measured joint angles normalized between 0 and 1, useful to monitor when some
 joints are getting close to their limits.
 - joint_vels: plot the measured joint velocities in deg/sec
